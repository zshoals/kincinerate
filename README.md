This is a WIP game framework using Kinc and Flecs. Mostly as an experiment to learn C and try and not get bogged down by screwing around with tons of features that other languages have.

All modules use the prefix **burn_** to indicate that the function is a part of this library. The entry point is **burn_ignition**.
